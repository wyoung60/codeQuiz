## The Repository

Repository was created to build an online quiz. The page was to use JS to change elements dynamically. High score and initials were to be maintained using local storage.

## Challenges

How to recall local storage was very challenging. Initially wanted to use an object but could not determine how to stop overwriting the score of identical initials. Determined a work around using a set of temporary variables to load local storage values into an array. Time also became a factor as getting the page operational took priority to style. Traversing the DOM was a challenge to start but became second nature after a few tries.
